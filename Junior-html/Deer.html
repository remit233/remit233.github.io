    Deer live in a variety of biomes, which range from tundras to tropical rainforests. 
    Since deer are found in tons of biomes, throughout the years, deer were able to adapt to the changes 
    based on their habitats, meaning there are a number of types of deer that exist, 43 to be exact. Deer are 
    herbivores, and are selective feeders on plant food characterized by low fibre but high protein.
