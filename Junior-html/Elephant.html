    Elephants are the largest existing land animals. They are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and 
    Southeast Asia. Elephants are also found in different habitats, which include the likes of savannahs, forests, deserts,
    and marshes. Elephants constantly eat depending on their habitats. In dry conditions, elephants will mainly eat woody
    parts of trees and shrubs which include twigs, branches, and barks.
