    Leopard, also called panther, large cat closely related to the lion,
    tiger, and jaguar. The name leopard was originally given to the cat 
    now called cheetah—the so-called hunting leopard—which was once
    thought to be a cross between the lion and the pard. The term pard
    was eventually replaced by the name leopard.
