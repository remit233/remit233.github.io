    Lion is a large, powerfully built cat (family Felidae) that is second 
    in size only to the tiger. The proverbial “king of beasts,” the lion 
    has been one of the best-known wild animals since earliest times. 
    Lions are most active at night and live in a variety of habitats but 
    prefer grassland, savanna, dense scrub, and open woodland.
