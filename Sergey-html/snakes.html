    Snakes are elongated, limbless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes. Like all other
    squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species
    of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow
    prey much larger than their heads (cranial kinesis). To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired
    organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only
    one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side
    of the cloaca. Lizards have evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs about
    twenty-five times independently via convergent evolution, leading to many lineages of legless lizards.
    These resemble snakes, but several common groups of legless lizards have eyelids and external ears,
    which snakes lack, although this rule is not universal (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, and Pygopodidae).
