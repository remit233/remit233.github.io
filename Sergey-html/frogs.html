    A frog is any member of a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short-bodied, tailless
    amphibians composing the order Anura (ανοὐρά, literally without tail in Ancient Greek). The 
    oldest fossil "proto-frog" Triadobatrachus is known from the Early Triassic of Madagascar, 
    but molecular clock dating suggests their split from other amphibians may extend further back 
    to the Permian, 265 million years ago. Frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the tropics to
    subarctic regions, but the greatest concentration of species diversity is in tropical rainforest. 
    Frogs account for around 88% of extant amphibian species. They are also one of the five most diverse
    vertebrate orders. Warty frog species tend to be called toads, but the distinction between frogs and
    toads is informal, not from taxonomy or evolutionary history.
